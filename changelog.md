# v1.1.6

- Now using the optional [Custom Keybinds](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/geode.custom-keybinds) api (note: it's only available **on desktop**)

# v1.1.5

- Fixed that in the `waiting for selection` notification the keybind showed was the **default keybind** and not the currently set **keybind**
- Also fixed that the `Generated x color triggers` notification would show with the text `Generated 0 color triggers !!! (Should NOT happen btw)` even tho this should happen because of the <cb>`Generate only for selected objects`</cb> generator setting.

# v1.1.4

- Fixed a popup possibly showing on mobile when it shouldn't

# v1.1.3

- Made `Custom Keybinds` only a dependency on mac and windows (aka desktop)
