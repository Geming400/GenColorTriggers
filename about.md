# Generate Color Triggers

This mod brings back an old `Better edit V4` *(mod made by **HJFod**)* feature which purpose was to generate a color trigger for each color channels in a level.

---------

You can do this by pressing the <cb>**`F10`**</cb> keybind.
You can always **change it later** !

Or if you want to, you can activate the `Show editor button` setting to have a button in the <cy>edit tab</cy> that will do the same thing as pressing `F10`. *(**forced enabled on mobile**)*

On <cb>**mobile**</cb> you will need to go to the <cy>edit tab</cy> and press the new button added by this mod.

---------

There is also an UI that will show up whenever you press <cb>`F10`</cb> *(or the keybind you chose)* or the editor button.
**This UI is synced and *not* synced to this mod's settings.**

Whenever you open the UI, it will use the <cb>mod's settings value</cb>, but if you change at the same time while the <cb>**UI is opened**</cb> the mod's settings, the ui's generator options will **not** change.

---------

In this <cb>mod's setting</cb> you can also specify to generate the color channels for the "built-in" ones *(eg: BG, G, etc... colors)*.
This is <cg>**enabled**</cg> by default !
