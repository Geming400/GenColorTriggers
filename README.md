# Gen Color Triggers

This is where she makes a mod.

<img src="logo.png" width="150" alt="the mod's logo" />

This mod will let you be able to generate color triggers for every channels in the level.

In this mod's setting you can also specify to generate the color channels for the "built-in" ones *(eg: BG, G, etc... colors)*.
This is **enabled** by default !

I would've let this be usable with a keyboard on android because CK is actually usable on android, but that means that the `show-editor-button` would
be accessible on mobile, which **I do not want**.

## Maybe Todo idk

- [] add a `Copy in clipboard` button ??
- [] use the `getColorActions` member instead of a parser
- [x] Optional CK dependency
